# SKNet-Pytorch
Nearly Perfect &amp; Easily Understandable Implementation of [SKNET(Selective Kernel Networks)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06586) by PyTorch

I reimplemented SKNET using PyTorch. Although there are some implementations of SKNET using Pytorch, some implementations are different from original implementation descripted in the paper, and I was hard to understand their implementations, so I reimplemented SKNET.
